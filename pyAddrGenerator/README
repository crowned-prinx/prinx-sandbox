Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding Tool

This program allows users to convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude)
and vice versa using the Nominatim geocoding service. It supports:

- Address to coordinates conversion.
- Coordinates to address conversion (reverse geocoding).
- Input validation for addresses and coordinates.
- Default location based on the user's local timezone.

The program is built using the `geopy` library and is designed to handle user input errors gracefully,
providing informative feedback for invalid inputs or geocoding failures.
