Word Definition Lookup Program

This program allows users to look up the meaning of words from a JSON-based dictionary. 
It handles user input, suggests close matches for misspelled words, and displays definitions 
in a user-friendly format. The program uses the `difflib` library to provide suggestions 
for words not found in the dictionary and ensures robust error handling for file operations 
and JSON parsing.
